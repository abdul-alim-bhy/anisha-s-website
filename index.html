                <p>My name is Nusrat Fatema Anisha and I am a full-stack Web Application Developer and Software
                    Developer,
                    currently living in Philadelphia, PA. I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from

                    University, and my primary focus and inspiration for my studies is Web Development. In my free time,
                    I
                    study human computer interface and the psychology of human computer interaction. I am both driven
                    and
                    self-motivated, and I am constantly experimenting with new technologies and techniques. I am very
                    passionate about Web Development, and strive to better myself as a developer, and the development
                    community as a whole.</p>

                <h2>HTML</h2>
                <p>The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
                    displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
                    and scripting languages such as JavaScript. ... HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using
                    angle brackets</p>

                <h2>CSS</h2>
                <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a
                    document written in a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World
                    Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
                    CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and
                    formatting. </p>

                <h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>
                <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript
                    specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has
                    curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
